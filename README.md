# Aoba Hacked Client (1.16.5)
A custom hacked client for Minecraft 1.16.5. A personal project I've been working on for awhile.

!!! Currently there is no downloadable version of this client for you to run. There is a working JAR file but I cannot distribute it under compliance with Mojang's EULA. Source code is provided for others to make their own clients! :)

## Features
- Fully featured Alt Manager with MCLeaks integration.
- Working Command System.
- ClickGui with moveable/pinnable windows.
- Plenty of hacks.

## License
This code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. You may use code published here in your own clients under the same license.
